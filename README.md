- Full support for platform-specific C ABIs
- Full support for UTF-8 and Unicode
- Pattern matching and sum types
- Support for lambdas/closures
- Abbreviated lambda syntax for common use cases
- Ability to use if/elif/else and other constructs as values
- New chaining operators for abbreviating long conjunctions/disjunctions
- Enhanced standard library
- Even better cross compilation
- Improved compile time safety
- Improved package management and better ecosystem
- Better language server and new code formatter
- New documentation generator
- No more support for old alternative syntaxes
- Additional fixes for previous design mistakes
