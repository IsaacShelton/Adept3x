Work-in-progress compiler that will become Adept 3.x

```
func main {
    println("Hello World")
}
```

### Why Adept 3.x?

Adept 3.x is an attempt at creating a Next-Gen Programming Language.

It will have a comprehensive set of features that no other language fully offers:

- Easily Run Code at Compile-Time (no function annotations or separate file requirements)
- Easily Generate Arbitrary Functions, Structures, etc. at Compile-Time (even within same file - no ordering/annotation requirements)
- Easily Reference Values Safely with Borrow Checking & Move Semantics
- Easily Manage Data Variants with Pattern Matching & Sum Types
- Consider Goto Unharmful, Since They Are Safe and Structured in Adept
- Import C Headers and Source Files with First-Class Support
- Easily Cross-Compile to Other Platforms
- Compile Your Code Blazingly Fast (with or without Incrementatal Compilation)
- Receive Intelligent Language Server Completions/etc. even for Generated Symbols
