Work-in-progress compiler that will become Adept 3.x

```
func main {
    println("Hello World")
}
```

### Why Adept 3.x?

Adept 3.x is an attempt at creating a Next-Gen Programming Language.

It will have a comprehensive set of features that no other language fully offers:

- Borrow Checking & Move Semantics
- Pattern Matching & Sum Types
- Control-Flow Sensitive Type Checking
- Generic Refinement Types
- First-Class Support for C Headers and Source Files
- Full Support for Platform-Specific C ABIs
- Strongly Typed Polymorphism
- Easy Compile-Time Execution of Regular Code
- First-Class Cross Compilation
- Extremely Fast Compiliation Times

Additional features include:

- Flexible module system
- Full support for UTF-8 and Unicode
- Support for lambdas/closures
- Abbreviated lambda syntax for common use cases
- Ability to use if/elif/else and other constructs as values
- New chaining operators for abbreviating long conjunctions/disjunctions
- Batteries-included tooling:
	- Standard library
	- Package Manager
	- Formatter
	- Language Server
	- Documenation Generator
