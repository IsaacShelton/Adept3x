Work-in-progress compiler that will become Adept 3.x

```
func main {
    println("Hello World")
}
```

### Why Adept 3.x?

Adept 3.x is an attempt at creating a Next-Gen Programming Language.

It will have a comprehensive set of features that no other language fully offers:

- Easily Execute Regular Code at Compile-Time
- Easily Generate Functions, Structures, etc. at Compile-Time (even from within same file)
- Easily Reference Values Safely with Borrow Checking & Move Semantics
- Easily Manage Data Variants with Pattern Matching & Sum Types
- Control-Flow Sensitive Type Checking
- Safely Use Arbitrary Intrafunction Gotos
- Import C Headers and Source Files with First-Class Support
- Easily Cross-Compile to Other Platforms
- Compile Your Code Blazingly Fast (with or without Incrementatal Compilation)
- Receive Intelligent Language Server Completions/etc. even for Generated Symbols
